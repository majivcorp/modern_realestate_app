# uae_realestate_webapp

app is live on https://uae-realestate-webapp.vercel.app/ 

####This was based of tutorial by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y47gYvXchXM&t=1152s
* This employed the use of #ReactJS and #NextJS skills by building Realtor  Real Estate Application. 
* it encompsed features such as advanced property filtering, property details page with an image carousel
* The properties were primary catergorized into  rental homes and for-sale properties.

####From this tutorial, I learnt:
- React Best Practices
- Next.js best practices, 
- static generation, 
- and server-side rendering.
- Creating a User Interface using #ChakraUI
- And most importantly fetching data from unlimited sources using RapidAPI

Problems I encoutered when attempting to deploy on vercel,
Were eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y rule enforcements and  missing key prop (react/jsx-key) detection;
Documentation explaining said issue can be found in the links below;
